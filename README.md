The purpose of this system is to map the fundamental properties of sound: frequency, amplitude, and timbre to the properties of color: hue, saturation, luminosity. Likewise, a set of six unique sounds are played and controlled at different intervals for the purpose of creating a dynamic colour output. The hue of the colour is mapped to the 12 notes of an octave in Western Music, where each note represents a multiple of 30 in terms of hue. If more than one sound is being played at a given interval, the system use the average hue as the output. As a result, the hue will rarely output extremities (red and blue) and instead, lean towards the green side of the spectrum. Furthermore, the saturation is a combination of both a note's sustain duration and frequency. A longer sustain results in a higher saturation. In addition, the more a partial's frequency differs from its overtone counterpart, the lower the saturation. The opposite is also true for both of these. Lastly, luminosity increases and decreases relative to the amplitude. Amplitudes over 0.5 increase the luminosity and amplitudes below 0.5 decrease the luminosity. In short, this is a machine that turns sound into color.
