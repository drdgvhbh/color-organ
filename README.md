The purpose of this system is to map the fundamental properties of sound: frequency, amplitude, and timbre to the properties of color: hue, saturation, luminosity. Likewise, a set of six unique sounds are played and controlled at different intervals for the purpose of creating a dynamic colour output. The hue of the colour is mapped to the 12 notes of an octave in Western Music, where each note represents a multiple of 30 in terms of hue. If more than one sound is being played at a given interval, the system use the average hue as the output. As a result, the hue will rarely output extremities ( red and blue) and instead output colors that are closest to green on the spectrum.
